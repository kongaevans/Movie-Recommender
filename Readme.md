## Problem Statement

Human beings are faced with lots dilemma when it comes to choosing their needs among many presented choices.

And in business customers may be frustrated when selecting products to buy, Take for example Netflix MOVIES. There are lots of movies in which the customer may choose to watch. But the user may not know which movies he/she likes beforehand.

The above problem can be solved by building a recommendation engine which reccomends user movies based on what he/she liked in the past or what other users liked. This saves user time and increases the sales.

I am going to build a system that will recommend movies to the user based on user ratings using the (LightFM)[] library.

The code solution is in this (JupyterNotebook)[]
